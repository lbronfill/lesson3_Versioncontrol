            <p class="lead"> JavaScript is the language for interaction. A computer oriented programming language commonly used to create interactive effects with webpages. Designed to perform dynamic tasks to impact or manipulate the HTML file without having to change the website. JavaScript is created on the client side which means the user process the code instead of the web server. In order to Add JavaScript to your html page it can be coded externally on a JavaScript file or it can be added to the scipt elements at the top of the page. JavaScript brings animation, creativity, interaction and amazing effects. Javascript can be used to modify the DOM, when it is modified the browser immediately makes the necessary changes. All modern Browsers and devices understand or can implement JavaScript. The use and knowledge of JavaScript is imperative to this class so that we are able to spice up our web pages. Being able to use this universal language can help us become better web developers. Learning its importance and mastering the coding can make the difference from a Web Developer to a Web Master.Javascipt has become the language to know in order to becomes a web developer although there are plenty of other languages JavaScript is the main one. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Learning to code JavaScript statements can not be done without you following the JavaScript Syntax if you do not follow the rules the browser will not be able to understand the commands given. The first rule is that when you are coding you have to remember that JavaScript is case sensitive so the same word can have different context in JavaScript. The second rule is that each statement must end in semicolon. Also to not add extra white space within the statements because JavaScript will ignore them. Third rule is that you can however use comments  to add notes to help you or someone else identify or remind what it is that you are trying to do. There are two options when it comes to comments one is that comments can be blocked from displaying on the page by  starting with /* and ending with */.The alternative type of comment is the single line comment that would start with // and end with //. There can also be some cases when JavaScript thinks that you forgot to put a semicolon on a split line. Learning to code the statements is important to this class because those statements are what is necessary in order to revamp a website and provide the flare that it might need.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control system also known as a repository where you can save all the files when working on a project. Instead of saving multiple files with different dates and names in order to know which one you want. With a version control system other team memebers can simultaneously make changes to the file while leaving the information of what they did. If you ever want to go back to an older version of a specific file you are able to do so. Version Control is able to back track to older versions of the files that you have made changes to. There are types of repository the Remote repository and local repository. A remote repository resides in a remote server that is normally shared by multiple teammates in a company. In order to create a repository you can either create a new one or copy remote repository. In order to create a repository you can either create a new one or copy remote repository. Knowing how to use this version control system can save a lot of headache for web developers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You might be asking yourself what in the word is Git (sounds like a dogs name). Git was created by a company name Linux when the DVCS  called Bitkeeper broke down in 2005.So the Owner of Linux, Linus Torvalds developed their own version control using some of the toold they learned from Bitkeeper. Since created in 2005 Git has grown in popularity but still remaining user friendly with the initial qualities with a great branching system. Well Git is actually a free source of version control it was made to handle from small to a large amounts of files and everything in between. All users have a local repository on their machines. It is like a big safe with a glossary of everything that you have in that safe. Using Git can prevent any unintentional overwrite of any files of the repository. It is widely known in the wed developement industry and a intricate part of the Web world.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> An If Statement allows the user to control how that statement will be delivered. Each If statement must start with an IF clause after  it can have an else if clause but that is up to the user it becomes optional. If one statement is true then that means that the other must be fake for example if the age of of someone is 18 and can vote then it must mean that anyone else that is not 18 cannot vote, that would be an If statement with an else clause. The use of the If statement, If clause or the else clause is also known as nesting if statements. This applies to web development because it allows for the the computer to understand that if the conditional expression is true then the next statement is false and vice versa. Learning this in web development allows us to give the computer a different actions for different decisions and on how to execute this decisions. As the user the If statements can help us decide if we want the computer to say Good morning if it is before 12 or Good afternoon.  It is part of web development that helps the creator command webpages.</p>
